# spat(ial) ecology

This is a repository to share codes on spatial ecology analyses and simulations.

## Repository description

Until this moment, there is code to deal with:

- testing how fast are neighborhood analyses (i.e. moving window, filtering) performed with different tools in R (`focal` from `raster` and `terra` packages) and GRASS GIS (`r.neighbors` and `r.resamp.filter` modules, `r.mfilter` to be tested).

## Usage

These pieces of code are intended for educational and research purposes, you are free to use and modify them. If you do so, you are not obliged to share your code, but I really encourage you to do so! 
This is a living repository, intended to receive and share contributions from many people, so feel free to contribute as well. You can submit a pull request or contact me directly.
If you need any modification or found an error, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/bniebuhr/movecology/issues/new) or email me at bernardo_brandaum@yahoo.com.br.
